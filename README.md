# MoE-Infinity

MoE-Infinity is a cost-effective, fast, and easy-to-use library for Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) inference.

## Overview

MoE-Infinity runs large Mixture-of-Experts models on memory-constrained GPUs by **offloading expert weights to host memory (and SSD)** and fetching them just in time. An activation-aware cache keeps hot experts resident on the GPU, while activation tracing and prefetching hide most of the transfer cost. On top of the offloading runtime, MoE-Infinity ships a HuggingFace-compatible `MoE` class and an async, OpenAI-compatible serving engine with continuous batching, paged KV cache, and streaming.

This open-sourced version has been redesigned to be HuggingFace-friendly and differs from the version reported in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14361), which prioritizes extreme performance. **Single-server multi-GPU inference is supported** — expert parameters are distributed round-robin across all visible GPUs, with per-GPU caching, peer-to-peer transfers, and dedicated I/O threads. Multi-node distributed inference (across separate machines) is not yet supported.

## Features

Key benefits include:

- **Cost-effective.** Expert offloading to host memory/SSD lets memory-constrained GPUs serve MoE models that would otherwise not fit. DeepSeek-V4-Flash additionally offloads **FP4-quantized** experts for a large memory reduction.
- **Fast.** Activation-aware expert caching, prefetching, and tracing minimize offloading overhead; fused CUDA kernels, CUDA graph capture, Marlin INT4 GEMM, and FP4/MXFP4 expert paths accelerate the hot path.
- **HuggingFace-native.** Drop-in `MoE` class with the familiar `from_pretrained` / `generate` workflow, compatible with standard HuggingFace checkpoints.
- **Production serving.** OpenAI-compatible HTTP server with continuous batching, paged KV cache, request scheduling with preemption, prefix caching, streaming (SSE), runtime hot reload, watchdog/health monitoring, and crash-recovery logging.
- **Acceleration-aware.** Automatically integrates with [FlashAttention](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention) and [FlashInfer](https://flashinfer.ai/) when installed, with graceful fallback to built-in kernels.
- **Multi-GPU.** Single-server multi-GPU with round-robin expert distribution, per-GPU caching, and an in-memory N-way tensor-parallel shard loader.

## Installation

We recommend installing MoE-Infinity in a virtual environment. To install MoE-Infinity, you can either install it from PyPI or build it from source.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- CUDA-capable environment for GPU inference
- Recommended: isolated virtual environment

### Install from conda environment

```bash
conda create -n moe-infinity python=3.9
conda activate moe-infinity
# install from either PyPI or Source will trigger requirements.txt automatically
```

### Install from PyPI

```bash
# install stable release
pip install moe-infinity

# install nightly release (latest development build from main branch, published to PyPI as pre-release dev versions)
pip install --pre moe-infinity
```

### Install from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EfficientMoE/MoE-Infinity.git
cd MoE-Infinity
pip install -e .
conda install -c conda-forge libstdcxx-ng=12 # assume using conda, otherwise install libstdcxx-ng=12 using your package manager or gcc=12
```

### Enable FlashAttention (Optional)

Install FlashAttention (>=2.5.2) for faster inference with the following command.
```bash
FLASH_ATTENTION_FORCE_BUILD=TRUE pip install flash-attn
```
Post-installation, MoE-Infinity will automatically integrate with FlashAttention to enhance performance.

### Enable FlashInfer (Optional)

Install [FlashInfer](https://flashinfer.ai/) for optimized paged attention kernels during prefill and decode. FlashInfer provides significant speedups for paged KV cache attention compared to standard PyTorch SDPA.

```bash
# For CUDA 12.4 + PyTorch 2.5:
pip install flashinfer -i https://flashinfer.ai/whl/cu124/torch2.5/

# For CUDA 12.1 + PyTorch 2.4:
pip install flashinfer -i https://flashinfer.ai/whl/cu121/torch2.4/
```

Check the [FlashInfer installation guide](https://docs.flashinfer.ai/installation.html) for other CUDA/PyTorch version combinations.

Post-installation, MoE-Infinity will automatically detect and use FlashInfer for faster paged attention in both prefill and decode phases. When FlashInfer is not installed, MoE-Infinity gracefully falls back to its built-in attention kernels with no behavior change.

## Usage and Examples

We provide a simple API for diverse setups, including single GPU and multiple GPUs. The following examples show how to use MoE-Infinity to run generation on a Huggingface LLM model.

### Important Note

- The `offload_path` must be unique for each MoE model. Reusing the same `offload_path` for different MoE models will result in unexpected behavior.


### Sample Code of Huggingface LLM Inference

```python
import torch
import os
from transformers import AutoTokenizer
from moe_infinity import MoE

user_home = os.path.expanduser('~')

checkpoint = "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V2-Lite-Chat"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(checkpoint, trust_remote_code=True)

config = {
    "offload_path": os.path.join(user_home, "moe-infinity"),
    "device_memory_ratio": 0.75, # 75% of the device memory is used for caching, change the value according to your device memory size on OOM
}

model = MoE(checkpoint, config)

input_text = "translate English to German: How old are you?"
input_ids = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors="pt").input_ids.to("cuda:0")

output_ids = model.generate(input_ids)
output_text = tokenizer.decode(output_ids[0], skip_special_tokens=True)

print(output_text)
```

### Running Inference

Run on a single GPU:
```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python script.py
```

Run on multiple GPUs (expert parameters are automatically distributed across all visible devices):
```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 python script.py
```

We provide a simple example to run inference on a Huggingface LLM model. The script will download the model checkpoint and run inference on the specified input text. The output will be printed to the console.

```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python examples/interface_example.py --model_name_or_path "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V2-Lite-Chat" --offload_dir <your local path on SSD>
```

### Benchmarking

For correct throughput and latency measurement, it is critical to separate **prefill time (TTFT)** from **decode throughput**. Including prefill in your throughput calculation will produce misleadingly low numbers.

We provide a `StopWatch` utility and ready-to-use benchmark scripts. See the **[Benchmarking Guide](docs/benchmarking.md)** for:

- How to correctly measure decode throughput vs TTFT
- Common measurement pitfalls and how to avoid them
- Ready-to-use benchmark scripts (`benchmarks/serving/`)
- Fair comparison methodology with llama.cpp, vLLM, and other frameworks
- Tuning `device_memory_ratio` for optimal performance

Quick example using the benchmark scripts:
```bash
# Single-request baseline (TTFT + per-token latency + peak memory)
python benchmarks/serving/baseline_performance.py \
    --model deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V2-Lite-Chat \
    --offload-dir /path/to/offload/dir

# Throughput sweep across batch sizes
python benchmarks/serving/throughput.py \
    --model deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V2-Lite-Chat \
    --offload-dir /path/to/offload/dir \
    --batch-sizes 1 2 4 8 16

# Latency percentiles (TTFT + ITL at p50/p90/p99)
python benchmarks/serving/latency.py \
    --model deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V2-Lite-Chat \
    --offload-dir /path/to/offload/dir \
    --concurrency 1 2 4 8
```

### OpenAI-Compatible Server (Continuous Batching)

MoE-Infinity includes a continuous batching serving engine with an OpenAI-compatible API. The server supports concurrent requests, streaming, request scheduling with preemption, and paged KV cache management.

Start the server:
```bash
python -m moe_infinity.entrypoints.openai.api_server_v2 \
    --model deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V2-Lite-Chat \
    --offload-dir ./offload_dir \
    --device-memory-ratio 0.5 \
    --kv-cache-ratio 0.15 \
    --max-batch-size 8
```

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--device-memory-ratio` | 0.75 | Fraction of GPU memory for expert caching. Lower this if you hit OOM (0.5 is a safe starting point for 24GB GPUs). |
| `--kv-cache-ratio` | 0.25 | Fraction of remaining GPU memory for paged KV cache blocks. |
| `--max-batch-size` | 32 | Maximum number of concurrent sequences in a batch. |
| `--enable-prefix-caching` | off | Enable prefix caching for shared prompt prefixes. |

You can also start the server programmatically from Python:
```python
from moe_infinity import MoE

model = MoE("deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V2-Lite-Chat", {
    "offload_path": "./offload_dir/deepseek-v2-lite",
    "device_memory_ratio": 0.5,
})
model.serve(host="0.0.0.0", port=8000, offload_dir="./offload_dir")
```

Query via `/v1/completions`:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/v1/completions \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
        "model": "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V2-Lite-Chat",
        "prompt": "Hello, my name is",
        "max_tokens": 32
    }'
```

Query via `/v1/chat/completions` with streaming:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
        "model": "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V2-Lite-Chat",
        "messages": [
            {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
            {"role": "user", "content": "Tell me a joke"}
        ],
        "max_tokens": 128,
        "stream": true
    }'
```

Supported request fields: `model`, `prompt`/`messages`, `max_tokens`, `temperature`, `top_p`, `stop`, `stream`.

The server returns `finish_reason: "stop"` when the model emits an EOS token or hits a stop sequence, and `finish_reason: "length"` when `max_tokens` is reached.

The server also exposes operational endpoints:

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `/v1/models` | GET | List the loaded model(s). |
| `/health` | GET | Liveness/readiness state (`STARTING`, `HEALTHY`, `UNHEALTHY`). |
| `/metrics` | GET | Prometheus-format serving metrics. |
| `/admin/stats` | GET | Engine statistics (queue depth, batch sizes, cache hit rates). |
| `/v1/config` | GET / POST | Inspect and update runtime configuration. |
| `/v1/reload` | POST | Hot-reload server Python modules without restarting the process. |

You can also use the `openai` Python package:
```bash
pip install openai
python tests/python/integration/test_oai_completions.py
python tests/python/integration/test_oai_chat_completions.py
```

### Chat WebUI (Docker)

For interactive use (rather than curl/the `openai` package), [`docker-compose.webui.yml`](docker-compose.webui.yml) starts the OpenAI-compatible server together with [Open WebUI](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui) as a chat frontend, wired together via `OPENAI_API_BASE_URL`:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.webui.yml up -d --build
```

or with the bundled launch scripts, which also accept an optional model override:

```powershell
.\start-webui.ps1
.\start-webui.ps1 -Model openai/gpt-oss-20b
```

```bash
./start-webui.sh
./start-webui.sh openai/gpt-oss-20b
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) — on first launch, Open WebUI asks you to create a local admin account, after which the model configured via `MOE_MODEL` (default `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V2-Lite-Chat`) is available in the model picker. Override the served model without editing the file:

```bash
MOE_MODEL=openai/gpt-oss-20b docker compose -f docker-compose.webui.yml up -d --build
```

This requires an NVIDIA GPU with the [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html) on the host. The `moe-infinity` service builds from [`docker/Dockerfile.serve`](docker/Dockerfile.serve), which is dedicated to serving a model (not to running the test suite — see [`docker/Dockerfile`](docker/Dockerfile) for that).

By default this build skips `flash-attn`: it's a pure speed optimization (the server falls back to eager attention automatically when it's absent) but it compiles from source with no prebuilt wheel for this torch/CUDA/Python combination, making it by far the slowest and most RAM/disk-intensive part of the build. If you need maximum throughput and can afford the extra build time, include it with:

```bash
INSTALL_FLASH_ATTN=true docker compose -f docker-compose.webui.yml up -d --build
```

Stop the stack:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.webui.yml down
```

## ContextPilot Integration (Optional)

ContextPilot is an optional overlap-aware prompt optimization layer for shared-prefix and multi-turn workloads. You can enable it inside the OpenAI-compatible server before tokenization, or extend it into KV allocation and scheduling for deeper reuse gains.

Phase B quick start, in-process middleware:

```bash
python -m moe_infinity.entrypoints.openai.api_server_v2 \
    --model deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V2-Lite-Chat \
    --offload-dir ./offload_dir \
    --enable-contextpilot
```

Set `CONTEXTPILOT_ENABLED=0` to force-disable ContextPilot at runtime, even if the CLI flag is enabled.

Measured baseline on single A5000 (24 GB) with DeepSeek-V2-Lite-Chat (expert offloading):

| Workload | TTFT p50 | E2E p50 | Prefill tok/s |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Shared-prefix RAG | 3.70s | 5.29s | 25.4 |
| Multi-turn conversation | 3.82s | 5.46s | 26.3 |
| Batch with overlap | 2.21s | 2.69s | 35.5 |
| No-overlap baseline | 3.40s | 4.86s | 4.2 |

Projected Phase B/C improvements (based on [ContextPilot benchmarks on vLLM/SGLang](https://github.com/EfficientContext/ContextPilot)):

| Phase | Integration mode | Expected TTFT reduction | Expected token savings |
|---|---|---:|---:|
| Phase B | In-process middleware | 15–25% | 20–30% |
| Phase C | Deep scheduler integration | 20–30% | 25–35% |

Actual improvements depend on context overlap ratio. Run `python benchmarks/contextpilot/compare_phases.py` for detailed dry-run projections, or run Phase B against a live server for real measurements.

See [docs/contextpilot/README.md](docs/contextpilot/README.md) for setup details, CLI flags, environment variables, admin endpoints, and troubleshooting.
